        I&apos;m a Software Engineer and the Project Lead at Life Stages, a
        startup that aims to provide personalized wellness-aimed tools for users
        across different life stages. I have also completed a Master of Science
        in Software Engineering at San Jose State University, where I acquired
        advanced skills in multiple programming languages and software
        development processes. My passion for software engineering stems from my
        curiosity and creativity in solving real-world problems with innovative
        solutions, something we do at Life Stages. In addition to coding, I
        enjoy building side projects, learning about advancements in the
        industry, and reading wide range of books from fiction to philosophical
        works. When I&apos;m not doing anything intellect-related, I enjoy
        spending time with my friends, enjoying soccer, biking and working out.
